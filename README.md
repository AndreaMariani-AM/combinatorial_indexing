# Combinatorial_indexing (under dev)
Collection of some functions for combinatorial indexing experiments (scRNAseq for now).  
These functions will be supplied once the pipeline is ready. 

## TO DO:
1) Some folders are stil kinda hardcoded, or at least make some assumptions, and might crash if users supply non standard location for quantifications from alevin-fry. Further testing needed

# combinatorial_indexing
Collection of some functions for combinatorial indexing experiments.  
This functions will be supplied once the pipeline is ready. 

## TO DO:
1) Some folders are stil hardcoded
2) Explicitly state packages
3) If "other" annotated cells are trimmed, it breaks annotation as colData(sce)$barcodes > sample_df$bc
